# Install
Harvester can be installed with the [ISO](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/install/iso-install/) image or via [PXE](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/install/pxe-boot-install/) boot.

> **Note**
>
> **Configuration change**: 
> Starting from v1.1.0, the [`install.networks`](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.0/install/harvester-configuration#installnetworks) field is deprecated and replaced by the [`install.management_interface`](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/install/harvester-configuration#installmanagement_interface) field. Please check the example file [here](https://github.com/harvester/ipxe-examples/blob/55dab7661a5c14fdf7a8da52b35e40c349f0d03c/general/config-create.yaml#L13-L20).

# Upgrade
We highly recommend upgrading v1.0.3 clusters to v1.1.1 directly due to [known issues in v1.1.0](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/upgrade/previous-releases/v1-0-3-to-v1-1-0), and only the following upgrade path is supported for v1.1.1.
* [Upgrade from v1.0.3 to v1.1.1](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/upgrade/automatic/)
  * Due to [implementation changes](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/2236), all user VMs must be shut down before an upgrade.
